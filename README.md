## Introduction

* Simulating and Visualizing Schwarzschild Geometry is a software project with two separate sections each with different functions. 

* The first program provides an interactive simulation of the behavior of light particles near a black hole. 

* The second program creates a realistic image of how a black hole would be perceived by the human eye.
